Climate change poses a serious threat to global ecosystems, agricultural production and water resource management, especially the frequency of extreme weather events. Although Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Climate Change Prediction Model Interconnection (CMIP6) provide climate predictions, their low spatial resolution limits regional applications, and there is a strong need for high-resolution climate data to address local climate change challenges. The deep learning super-resolution model downscaling method can effectively improve the resolution of meteorological data, capture local climate details, and provide accurate support for climate change response. Therefore, this study proposes a downscaling framework based on super-resolution models, and by comparing the performance of multiple super-resolution models, the optimal model is screened and downscaled to 10-km resolution for the future CMIP6 climate data in the Chinese region. The results show that the RCAN model performs optimally in the downscaling of the four climate metrics, Tas, Pr, Rsds and Sfcwind, and its spatial distribution is highly consistent with that of the ERA5 data, and the mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by 88.65%, 35.83%, 51.02%, and 74.09%, respectively, compared with the traditional double-cubic interpolation method. In terms of temporal performance, the performance of all models has significant seasonal variations for solar radiation and precipitation, and the errors are larger in summer, while the errors for temperature and wind speed are relatively stable throughout the year. For extreme climate events, the correlation coefficients of the RCAN model for the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) and the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) reach 0.978 and 0.976, and the correlation coefficients of the other extreme climate metrics are all higher than 0.990.The downscaling of the two climate models of CMIP6 by using RCAN generates the four climate metrics of the Chinese region during the period of 2015-2100 The high-resolution dataset of The future climate scenarios show increasing trends in temperature and precipitation, decreasing trends in wind speed, and changes in radiation vary according to scenarios and regional differences, especially in the Tibetan Plateau, the Northeast, and the Southeast coastal regions. The framework and RCAN model proposed in this study provide high-resolution climate data to support regional climate change assessment and decision-making, and help to accurately address the challenges posed by future climate change.
